# Barebones config for waywall
Barebones config for waywall based of what a lot of top runners use (Doogile, Feinberg, etc.)

## Setup
You can use it by either downloading `init.lua` and placing it in your waywall config directory `~/.config/waywall/`, or by cloning the repository with the following command.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjuncgore/waywall_barebones_config.git ~/.config/waywall
```
IMPORTANT: If you already have a config set up, you will need to move it either manually or with this command
```bash
mv ~/.config/waywall ~/.config/waywall.bkp
```
If you have a 1440p monitor, add this argument to the clone command `-b 1440`

## Overlay
This config requires a 30 pixel wide measuring overlay like the one provided, or you can generate your own with this link, setting the overlay width to 30.

## Ninbot
Make sure your ninjabrain bot (and paceman if you need it) are in the following directory `~/mcsr/`, or change the path at the start of `init.lua`.

## How I made it
Here's a timelapse video of me creating the configuration if you're interested
